# FEWD, Lesson 7 Notes


#### Key Terms:

 * _Variables_ - Like containers, a place to store temporary data or values for later use.
 * _Functions_ - Like verbs, these allow for manipulation and alteration of _variables_, and even other functions.
 * _Conditionals_ - Statements (like if...then statements) that are executed only if a certain condition is met.
 * _Loops_ - Repeating sections of a computer program.


#### Thermostat Solutions

Using a _while_ loop:
```
set target_temperature
while (current_temperature < target_temperature):
  heat_by_one_degree
  measure current_temperature
```

Using a _do...until_ loop:
```
set target_temperature
repeat:
	heat_by_one_degree
    measure current_temperature
until (current_temperature >= target_tmperature)
```
